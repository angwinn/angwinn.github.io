<h3>About Me<small>1/20/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="Family.jpg">
<p>Hey there! I'm so glad you're here checking out my little blog! I'm trying to make the most of nap times and evenings to cook, bake, wife, and blog. Yes, I just used wife as a verb- mainly because I'm learning to balance being a mom and wife at the same time. My name's Michelle and I'm a 20- something year old Louisiana girl, born and raised in an anything but Southern multi-cultural home. I've been saved by the grace of God, and Lord knows, I rely on that grace daily. I'm married to the most wonderful man and we welcomed our first baby, Maverick, on March 17th of 2016!
<p>
With all of that being said, I decided to make my dream of being a blogger a reality and created this little gem. Here you will find all of our family's adventures (we're really funny, people- if I do say so myself), first-time mom advice/experiences (because let's be real, this is all a learning process so why not dish out what I'm learning), all things marriage and being first time parents (everyone loves a good 'I just got peed on' story) and so many other things- so go ahead and check out the above menu!
<p>
I hope this journey of a blog inspires you, makes you laugh, and gives you great ideas.</p>

<h3>Nutella Thumbprint Cookie<small>1/21/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://emilybites.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Nutella-Thumbprints-whole.jpg">
<p>There’s just something about Nutella. I’m not sure if it’s just all nostalgic because I’ve had Nutella since I was a toddler, or if simply because it’s chocolate! Nonetheless, I made these cookies on a whim because Papou (which is grandpa in Greek) keeps bringing Nutella over to our house. One time we had 5 unopened jars. The love for it clearly runs deep and obviously the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
<p>
Without further ado here’s the most decadent Nutella cookies ever!
<p>
<p>Ingredients:
<p>1 large egg room temperature
<p>3/4 cup Nutella room temperature
<p>1 cup all-purpose-flour spoon and level
<p>
<p>For the filling:
<p>1/2 cup Nutella room temperature
<p>Crushed nuts (optional)
<p>
<p>Instructions:
<p>- Mix the egg and Nutella until it’s well incorporated.
<p>- Slowly add the flour (you may not need all of it, just enough to where it’s not sticky to the touch)
<p>- Wrap the bowl and let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
<p>
<p>Directions:
<p>- Roll them into small balls and make a little dent in the top for the filling. It may be easier to pipe the filling instead of using a spoon.
<p>- Bake at 350 degrees  for 10 minutes!
<p>- Sprinkle with any kind of crushed nuts!
<p>
<p>Let me know if you try these out in the comments!! They’ve definitely become a staple in our home when we have company since they are so easy to make!! </p>
